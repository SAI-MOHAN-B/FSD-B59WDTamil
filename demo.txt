Callback:
What is the Diff Between synchronous vs Asynchronous?
SetTimeOut
EventLoop Mechanism
How call backs are created some Basic Examples...
Callback Hell


What is synchronous and Asynchronous?
Asynchronous?


SetTimeOut:
It is a Inbuilt Asynchronous Function:
The main Purpose is to display the data after a certain Period Of Time
syntax:SetTimeOut(()=>{},time in millisec)

console.log("App is starting!!");
console.log("App is under Construction");
setTimeout(()=>console.log("This is a testing time"),3000);
setTimeout(()=>console.log("This is a developemnt review time"),3000);
console.log("App is under deployment");
console.log("App Ends!!!");


Event Loop Mechanism:
Callstack
WebAPI
Callback Queue
Event Loop

Callstack:
It's a Ledgure Which is used to keep the track of the Functions
It Is the Place where the  actual Code Get's Executed


WebAPI:
This is the Place where the actual TimeConsuming Operations Wait for the Specific Durations
Once the waiting Period Over it Will be Pushed back to the Queue

Callback Queue:
It is the place where the Time Consuming Operations are placed One after the another


Event loop:
It is an Intermediatery Between Callstack and Callback Queue
The Main Purpose of the Event Loop is to check whether the Call stack is empty or Not
if it is Empty It will be Pushed  to call stack

What is Callback and Uses

The function which is sent as a parameter to the another function
is nothing but call back function


The function which is sent as a parameter is nothing but callback function

Ex:map,reduce,filter,sort,addEventListerner,SetTimeOut
